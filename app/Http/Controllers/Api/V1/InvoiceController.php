/**
 * Key Features Explained:

 * Index Method:
    * The index() method retrieves a paginated list of invoices.
    * It utilizes the InvoicesFilter class to transform query parameters into conditions for filtering the invoices.
    * If no filters are applied, it returns all invoices. If filters exist, they are applied to the query.

 * Bulk Store Method:
    * The bulkStore() method validates and stores multiple invoices in bulk.
    * It processes each invoice in the request data, excluding unnecessary fields such as customerId, billedDate, and paidDate.
    * The processed data is then inserted into the database in one query for efficiency.

 * Show Method:
    * The show() method retrieves a single invoice resource by its identifier and returns it as a formatted resource.

 * Use of Resources:
    * The controller uses InvoiceResource and InvoiceCollection to transform the invoice models into a consistent JSON response format for the API.
